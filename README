A previous version of this directory contained several geojson files
and a directory called "all_results". Now it's different. The new
version of the directory allows us to save downloads from different dates.

There is one directory called "requests" with reasonably raw forms of
the downloads. nyc-crime-map writes a directory "~/.nyc-crime-map",
and "requests" is this directory.

There are several directories named in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, an in each
of them is several geojson files. For old downloads, before the newest
version of the program, there is also a directory containing relatively
raw forms of the original downloads.
