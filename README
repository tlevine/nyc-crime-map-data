A previous version of this directory contained several geojson files
and a directory called "all_results". The new version of the directory
allows us to save downloads from different dates.

There are several directories named in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, an in each
of them is several geojson files and a directory containing relatively
raw forms of the original downloads.
